### A 3D turn-based RPG engine and adventure ###


The SilverTree RPG project will produce  a 3D RPG with a hybrid real time, turn based system.

SilverTree intends to include a wide range of adventuring activities, in addition to combat and looting.  In the wilderness tracking and stealth can provide the all-important element of surprise in combat, or allow the player to avoid more powerful foes.  Literacy allows characters to use books and manuscripts to study new skills.

Grinding will be minimized.  Less experience is gained each time the same type of enemy is defeated, and healing is not easily obtained.  Most enemies will try to flee from the PC when they have little chance of survival.

SilverTree will allows play as several different types of heros.  The PC's response to moral dilemmas will be measured on several scales such as _Honest_
